# Minecraft Recipe Plugin
- Remake Version of [Add Recipe](https://github.com/AtSignRANK/Add-Recipe)

## How do I use it?
- Download Plugin Jar from Release
- Add Plugin in your server plugins directory
- run `/recipe:recipe load` to load the recipe you added
- if you run `/recipe:recipe load` twice, it makes exception

## Then, what is `/recipe:recipe unload`?
- You can think it doesn't work.
- But it works! If you want to load config.yml, use it
- Or you can use `/recipe:recipe reload` too!
